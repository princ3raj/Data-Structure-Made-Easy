 Following are some of the applications that use queues.
 Direct Applications
 • Operating systems schedule jobs (with equal priority) in the order of arrival (e.g., a print queue).
 • Simulation of real-world queues such as lines at a ticket counter or any other first- come first-served scenario requires a queue.
 • Multiprogramming.
 • Asynchronous data transfer (file IO, pipes, sockets).
 • Waiting times of customers at call center.
 • Determining number of cashiers to have at a supermarket.

 5.6 Implementation
 There are many ways (similar to Stacks) of implementing queue operations and some of the commonly used methods are listed below.
 • Simple circular array based implementation
 • Dynamic circular array based implementation
 • Linked list implementation

#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // insert code here...
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
}
